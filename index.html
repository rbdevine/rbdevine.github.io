    <h3>C02 On the Rise</h3>
    <p>C02 output into the atmosphere due to human activity has been on the rise in the past 5 decades.</p>

  <div id="Scene2Content" class="scenetext">
    <h3>Nature's Role in Balancing C02</h3>
    <p>Nature currently outputs approximately 771 GT (gigatons) of CO2, but is capeable of aborbing 788 GT, leaving a net, -17 GT that it can absorb of the CO2 produced by human activity (a number the human-caused CO2 output exceeded decades ago). When natural resources such as the 2.7 sq. miles of rainforest the Amazon basin in south America are reduced due to deforestation, the amount of CO2 that can be absorbed is significantly reduced, leaving even more excess CO2 in the atmosphere.</p>

    <h3>C02 Density Increasing</h3>
    <p>As more and more C02 is put into the atmosphere, its density also increases. The density accelerates the rise in the earth's surface temperature by trapping more of the warm air.</p-->

    <h3>Earth's Surface Temperature Rising with CO2</h3>
    <p>As more CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere, the density of CO2 increases, which in turn causes a number of geophysical phenomenon, one of which is the heating up of the earth's surface.  Although the earth's surface temperature has gone through many cycles over the broad scale of geological time, it has been relatively stable for the past fews thousand years. That has changed in the last half century as more and more CO2 due to human activity has been released.</p>

    <h3>Glacier Surface Area Reduction</h3>
    <p>As the earth has been heating up over the past few decades, the glaciers located at the its two poles have been dramatically losing surface area. This trend is expected to accelerate in the coming decades. The measurement shown on the graph below is the cumulative change in mass balance of a set of “reference” glaciers worldwide beginning in 1945. The values represents the average of all the glaciers that were measured. Negative values indicate a net loss of ice and snow compared with the base year of 1945. For consistency, measurements are in meters of water equivalent, which represent changes in the average thickness of a glacier.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="Scene5Content" class="scenetext">
    <h3>Sea Level Rise</h3>
    <p>As the glaciers melt, their massive volumes are transfromed from ice to water, causing a rise in sea level. Scientist warn that every inch of sea level rise will result in catastrophic consequences for coastal cities. Island nations, such as Kerabas and the Maldives are particularly at risk.</p>
