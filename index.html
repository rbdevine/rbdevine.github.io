    <h3>C02 On the Rise</h3>
    <p>C02 output into the atmosphere due to human activity has been on the rise in the past 4 decades.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="Scene2Content" class="scenetext">
    <h3>Nature's Role in Balancing C02</h3>
    <p>Nature currently outputs approximately 771 GT (gigatons) of CO2, but is capeable of aborbing 788 GT, leaving a net -17 GT that it can absorb of the C02 produced by human activity. When natural resources such as the 2.7 sq. miles of rainforest the Amazon basin in south America are reduced due to deforestation, the amount of C02 that can be absorbed is significantly reduced.</p>
  </div>
  
  <!--div id="Scene3Content" class="scenetext">
    <h3>C02 Density Increasing</h3>
    <p>As more and more C02 is put into the atmosphere, its density also increases. The density accelerates the rise in the earth's surface temperature by trapping more of the warm air.</p-->

  <div id="Scene3Content" class="scenetext">
    <h3>Earth's Surface Temperature Rising with CO2</h3>
    <p>The surface temperature of the earth on both land and water, relatively stable for thousands of years, began a sharp incline as more CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere.</p>

  <div id="Scene4Content" class="scenetext">
    <h3>Glacier Surface Area Reduction</h3>
    <p>The earth glaciers located at the earth's two poles have been dramatically losing surface area in the past few decades. The trend is expected to accelerate in the coming decades. The measurment shown is the cumulative change in mass balance of a set of “reference” glaciers worldwide beginning in 1945. The values represents the average of all the glaciers that were measured. Negative values indicate a net loss of ice and snow compared with the base year of 1945. For consistency, measurements are in meters of water equivalent, which represent changes in the average thickness of a glacier.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="Scene5Content" class="scenetext">
    <h3>Sea Level Rise</h3>
    <p>As the glaciers melt, their massive volumes are transfromed from ice to water, causing a rise in sea level. Scientist warn that each inch of sea level rise will result in catastrophic consequences for coastal cities. Island nations, such as Kerabas and the Maldives are particularly at risk.</p>
